'''Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element 
in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]'''

x=[(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
last=x[1][0]
